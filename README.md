# `bitsandbytes`

The `bitsandbytes` library is a lightweight Python wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and 8 & 4-bit quantization functions.

The library includes quantization primitives for 8-bit & 4-bit operations, through `bitsandbytes.nn.Linear8bitLt` and `bitsandbytes.nn.Linear4bit` and 8-bit optimizers through `bitsandbytes.optim` module.

This fork is actively developed for ROCm and updates are being pushed into `multi-backend-refactor` branch of upstream bitsandbytes. Users can use either of these to run bitsandbytes on AMD GPUs.

**Note: The default branch of this fork is switched from `rocm_enabled` to `rocm_enabled_multi_backend`. This is synced periodically with `multi-backend-refactor` branch of upstream, and latest developments are pushed here until upstream branch is merged into `main`.**

**Installation for ROCm:**

For latest develop version:
```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/ROCm/bitsandbytes
cd bitsandbytes
git checkout rocm_enabled_multi_backend
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
cmake -DCOMPUTE_BACKEND=hip -S . #Use -DBNB_ROCM_ARCH="gfx90a;gfx942" to target specific gpu arch
make
pip install .
```

## `bitsandbytes` multi-backend _alpha_ release is out!

üöÄ Big news! After months of hard work and incredible community contributions, we're thrilled to announce the **bitsandbytes multi-backend _alpha_ release**! üí•

Now supporting:
- üî• **AMD GPUs** (ROCm)
- ‚ö° **Intel CPUs** & **GPUs**

We‚Äôd love your early feedback! üôè

üëâ [Instructions for your `pip install` here](https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/installation#multi-backend)

We're super excited about these recent developments and grateful for any constructive input or support that you can give to help us make this a reality (e.g. helping us with the upcoming Apple Silicon backend or reporting bugs). BNB is a community project and we're excited for your collaboration ü§ó
